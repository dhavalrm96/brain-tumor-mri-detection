# brain-tumor-mri-detection
A deep learning-powered web application that analyzes MRI brain scans to detect and classify brain tumors using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with VGG16 architecture to classify brain MRI images into four categories:
Glioma - A type of brain tumor
Meningioma - Tumor of the brain and spinal cord
Pituitary - Pituitary gland tumor
No Tumor - Normal brain scan

## Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Flask
AI/ML: TensorFlow, Keras, VGG16
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5
Image Processing: PIL, NumPy
Model Training: Jupyter Notebook
